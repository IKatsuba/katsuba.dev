ECMAScript 5 includes many utilitarian methods for working with arrays to JavaScript:

- `Array.isArray()`
- `Array.prototype.every()`
- `Array.prototype.filter()`
- `Array.prototype.forEach()`
- `Array.prototype.indexOf()`
- `Array.prototype.lastIndexOf()`
- `Array.prototype.map()`
- `Array.prototype.reduce()`
- `Array.prototype.some()`

The next standards added find, findIndex, flat, flatMap, fill, etc. But it still seems to me that this is not enough. In this article, I discuss what methods I am missing when working with arrays.

---

## 1\. The first and last Getters

One of the most common use cases is to get the first and last value of an array.

`Array.prototype.first` is a getter that returns the first element of an array. If the array is empty, then the getter will return `undefined`.

```typescript
const items = [1, 2, 3, 4];
//before
const first = items[0];
//after
const first = items.first;
```

The code is no better. You can comfortably code without the `first` getter. But to get the last element of the array, we definitely need to know its length. The `last` getter will free us from this dependency.

`Array.prototype.last` is a getter that returns the last element of the array. If the array is empty, then the getter will return `undefined`.

```typescript
const items = [1, 2, 3, 4];
//before
const last = items[items.length - 1];
//after
const last = items.last;
```

There is an example of using `last` and `first` together with destructuring

```typescript
const items = [1, 2, 3, 4];
//before
const last = items[items.length - 1];
const first = items[0];
//after
const { first, last } = items;
```

## 2\. Array.prototype.clear()

There are many ways to clear an array in JavaScript. By [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1232040/how-do-i-empty-an-array-in-javascript), you can read about 4 of them with explanations about performance.

For example:

```typescript
const items = [1, 2, 3, 4];
items.splice(0, items.length);
//or
while (items.length > 0) {
  items.pop();
}
```

The code looks unreadable. It’s not even clear what the developer wants to achieve.

I present to your attention `Array.prototype.clear` — a method that clears an array.

```typescript
const items = [1, 2, 3, 4];
items.clear();
console.log(items);
```

The code is clean, short, and readable.

## 3\. Array.prototype.get(index)

I don't like the way to get an element from an array by index. I want to use the `get` method for this. I have no particular reason why the `get` method is better than the classic square brackets, but I like it better.

`Array.prototype.get` is a method that returns an array item by index.

```typescript
const items = [1, 2, 3, 4];
//before
const two = items[1];
const three = items[2];
//after
const two = items.get(1);
const three = items.get(2);
```

## 4\. Array.prototype.insert(index, …elements)

There are three methods to insert an element into an array:

1\. `push` to insert at the end of the array,

2\. `unshift` to insert at the beginning

3\. `splice` to insert elements from a specific position.

Everything is clear with push and unshift. But with `splice` everything is a little more interesting. This method can both remove elements and insert them. I would apply a different method for each operation. And the first one is to insert.

`Array.prototype.insert` is a method that can insert elements into an array starting from the specified index.

```typescript
const items = [1, 2, 3, 4];
//before
items.splice(1, 0, 3);
console.log(items);
//after
items.insert(1, 3);
console.log(items);
```

---

## 5\. Array.prototype.delete(item)

To remove an item from an array, we first need to get its index and then delete it.

`Array.prototype.delete` is a method that can delete items without an index

```typescript
const items = [1, 2, 3, 4];
//before
const index = items.indexOf(item);
items.splice(index, 1);
//after
items.delete(item);
```

---

## 6\. Array.prototype.deleteAt(index)

`Array.prototype.deleteAt` is a method that deletes an array item by its index.

```typescript
const items = [1, 2, 3, 4];
//before
items.splice(index, 1);
//after
items.deleteAt(index);
```

---

## 7\. Array.prototype.deleteWhere((item, index) ⇒ boolean)

`Array.prototype.deleteWhere` is a method that removes all array elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. The function will be called for each of the elements. If the function returns `true`, then the element will be removed.

```typescript
const items = [1, 2, 3, 4];
//before
const itemsForDelete = items.filter((item) => item % 2 === 0);
itemsForDelete.forEach((item) => {
  const index = items.indexOf(item);
  items.splice(index, 1);
});
//after
items.deleteWhere((item) => item % 2 === 0);
```

`deleteWhere` works like the`filter` method, but with one important difference: `deleteWhere` mutates the original array.

---

## 8\. Array.prototype.findLast((item, index) ⇒ boolean)

`Array.prototype.findLast` is a method that returns the last element of the array that passes the condition.

```typescript
const items = [1, 2, 3, 4];
//before
const item = items.reverse().find(fn); // the reverse method mutates the array
//after
const item = items.findLast(fn);
```

---

## 9\. Array.prototype.findLastIndex((item, index) ⇒ boolean)

`Array.prototype.findLastIndex` is a method that returns the last index of an element that passes the condition.

```typescript
const items = [1, 2, 3, 4];
//before
const index = items.reverse().findIndex(fn); // the reverse method mutates the array
//after
const index = items.findLastIndex(fn);
```

---

## 10\. Array.prototype.shuffle()

`Array.prototype.shuffle` is a method that shuffles an array in place and returns it.

```typescript
const items = [1, 2, 3, 4];
//before
items.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);
//after
items.shuffle();
```

## Conclusion

I have listed my top methods, the lack of which I feel most often. Perhaps some of them will appear in the next versions of the ECMAScript standard. What methods for working with collections in JavaScript are you missing?
