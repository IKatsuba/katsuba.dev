Hello everyone! 🌟 This is the first part of
[the previously announced series](./micro-frontend-architecture) of posts about an application with
a micro-frontend architecture. Not everyone will have the same needs, but I hope everyone will find
interesting information 📚.

So, let’s get started. We’ll be talking about the architecture of the front-end part of a CRM
system.

## **What is a CRM? 🤔**

CRM functions as a centralized task dispatcher for our agents in our company. Imagine a high-tech
office assistant that distributes tasks among employees. When an agent logs into the system, this
assistant starts directing tasks to them — calls from clients, chat questions, or tasks to call
potential clients. Thus, the agent always knows what to do and can focus on interacting with clients
instead of searching for what to start with. CRM here is a smart tool that helps efficiently
organize customer service, ensuring every query is heard, and every need is met 🎯.

## **Main application requirements 🔍**

I won’t delve into functional and non-functional requirements in detail but will highlight those
that significantly affect the high-level architecture of the application:

1.  **Scalability and long-term development.** The application should be designed to easily adapt to
    changes in business processes and scale according to growing needs.
2.  **Support for various tasks.** CRM should handle different types of tasks (incoming calls,
    chats, client call-outs), with each type of task managed by a separate team.
3.  **Independence of releases by different teams.**
4.  **Fast integration of new features.** The application’s architecture should support flexible and
    quick addition of new functions.
5.  **Conducting experiments.** The business should conduct quick experiments with new ideas and
    functions, and the CRM architecture should support A/B testing and be ready for rapid
    iterations.

Implementation of the backend, authorization of requests, task balancing, and similar aspects will
be outside the scope of this series of posts.

## **Key architectural and process decisions 🏗**

Here’s what the high-level design of such a system might look like:

📦 **Main application container.** Serves as the “skeleton” for the entire application, managing
authentication, navigation, and user session state. Responsible for loading the appropriate
micro-frontends based on user actions and access rights.

🧩 **Microfrontends for each type of task.** Incoming calls, chats with clients, outgoing calls,
etc., are developed as separate micro-frontends, each managed by a corresponding team. However, in
the layered architecture we’ve adopted, any functionality part can be made into a microfront.

📚 **Layered architecture.** We’ve based our design on the FSD idea, where the entire application is
divided into several layers. There are clear dependencies and restrictions between layers. This
ensures low code coupling, modularity, and independence of each new feature introduced. This
directly affects the extendibility and speed of feature integration.

🤝 **Monorepo** for the entire application with all products. This allows sharing of all
developments between products and common CI/CD pipelines and makes it much easier to conduct
integration cross-checks. At one point, we tried to move one of the products to a separate repo but
faced numerous problems and abandoned the idea.

🔄 **CI/CD and TBD.** We firmly decided to follow these practices. We considered other options, but
having different team release plans makes any other option almost impossible. Following TBD
naturally allows for conducting A/B tests and quick experiments.

## **Summary ✨**

We have defined the application and the requirements that fundamentally influence the decisions
made. In the next posts, we will discuss each requirement separately and in detail, but first, let’s
discuss the technical stack. Stay tuned!🚀📈
