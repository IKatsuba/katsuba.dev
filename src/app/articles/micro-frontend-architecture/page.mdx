**Announcement! A series of posts on the secrets of developing an application with a micro-frontend
architecture**

Iâ€™ll lift the veil on the mystery and delve into how weâ€™re developing one of the biggest web
applications at PLATA.

Get ready for a series of posts that will cover:

- **Architecture Overview.** This is an introduction to the applicationâ€™s structure and overall
  design. Iâ€™ll show how micro-frontends are integrated into the overall ecosystem and how this
  contributes to better modularity and separation of responsibilities.
- **Technical Stack.** A deep (but not too deep) dive into the technologies that underpin the
  application. Weâ€™ll explore how the choice of frameworks, libraries, and tools affects the
  development and support of the micro-frontend architecture.
- **State Management and Communication.** Weâ€™ll investigate how the application manages the state
  and ensures effective communication between micro-frontends.
- **Challenges and Solutions.** Iâ€™ll share real challenges faced by the development team and the
  solutions applied to overcome them.
- **Security and Performance.** Highlighting key aspects of security and performance optimization.
- **Best Practices.** I hope to share in each post about the best practices drawn from experience
  working on the application, with advice on applying technologies and micro-frontends in your
  projects.

Join me, and donâ€™t miss out!
