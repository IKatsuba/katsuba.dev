Angular is a big and complicated framework. Like any complex tool, you can‚Äôt learn it for 2 days. You have to work hard and practice for several years to begin to feel comfortable using it.

I have identified 3 main steps that let me understand Angular.

## Stage 1. üßë‚Äçüíª NgMan Begins.

The first stage began for me when I created an Angular project the first time. It was a payment page and a result page. I generated the project with `ng new` and learned [tutorials](https://angular.io/tutorial) from the official documentation. I have supported and developed this app for one year.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned this year:

1.  Learned to use [directives](https://angular.io/guide/attribute-directives), [components](https://angular.io/guide/architecture-components), and [modules](https://angular.io/guide/architecture-modules) correctly.
2.  Researched a [base routing configuration](https://angular.io/guide/router), including [lazy routing](https://angular.io/guide/lazy-loading-ngmodules).
3.  Learned to use [template-driven](https://angular.io/guide/forms) and [reactive](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms) forms.
4.  Used built-in [pipes](https://angular.io/guide/pipes). Wrote new pipes myself.
5.  Used [HttpClient](https://angular.io/guide/http) for messaging with a server and wrote interceptors.
6.  Used base CLI features: build, serve, test, lint, new, generate
7.  Learned to understand the `angular.json` format.
8.  Used [external schematic collections](https://angular.io/guide/schematics-for-libraries) for code generation.
9.  Learned the [injector hierarchy](https://angular.io/guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection). Used InjectionToken and providers (ClassProvider, ValueProvider, FactoryProvider). Read about resolution modifiers, but used only `Optional`.
10. Learned the Change Detection strategies. Optimized performance with [ChangeDetectorRef](https://angular.io/api/core/ChangeDetectorRef)
11. Read about [zone.js](https://angular.io/guide/zone). Learned how to run async tasks outside the Angular zone.

I think I had the right start. I learned basic Angular features and builded the app for production! I was so happy and excited. This stage prepared me well for the next one.

## Stage 2. ü•∑ CDK Ninja.

After application development, I started to develop a proprietary library of reusable components using `@angular/cdk`.

Result:

1.  Created new [structure directives](https://angular.io/guide/structural-directives) myself.
2.  Deep learned [lifecycle hooks](https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks) of components, directives, and services.
3.  Learned `ng-packagr` and Angular Package Format.
4.  Learned how to write schematics for code generation.
5.  Wrote [simple migrations](https://angular.io/guide/schematics#update-schematics).
6.  Learned and used all [providers](https://angular.io/api/core/Provider#provider).
7.  Used [tree-shakable providers and services](https://angular.io/guide/providers).
8.  Used all DI resolution modifiers, including the `Host` decorator.
9.  Learned the [inject](https://angular.io/api/core/inject) function and its using context.
10. Learned a difference between providers and viewProviders.
11. Started learning Angular source code.

The development of the UI Kit boosted my understanding of all the processes in Angular. I was able to deep dive into the features of the framework like DI and Change Detection. The third stage opened the last part unknown to me.

## Stage 3. üÖ∞Ô∏è Angular FrontOps

A year ago, I was invited to an interview at [Tinkoff.ru](http://tinkoff.ru/). The guys painted everything so colorfully that I accepted a job offer. I started working in the platform team. It was the start of Stage 3.

Result:

1.  Learn to write CLI builders and webpack plugins.
2.  Started to write hard migrations. Created a high-level library for source code mutations.
3.  Learned to extend and create platforms for Angular running.
4.  Created a framework for microfrontends (WIP)
5.  Learned to customize `ng-packagr` and write typescript transformers.
6.  Learned [Angular Universal](https://angular.io/guide/universal).

This stage is not finished yet, but it showed me Angular from the other side. Usually, developers don‚Äôt customize or extend Angular CLI. They use standard platforms. But I have learned to solve problems and tasks in different ways.

## Summary

I very shortly talked about the stages that I went through when learning Angular. Each stage opened many new framework features for me, but I cannot say that I know everything about it even now. And I hope this is just the beginning!
