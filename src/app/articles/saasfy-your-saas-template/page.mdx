Hey everyone! My name is Igor. I am a software engineer. For 10 years, I created a ton of small,
big, private, and public SaaS for someone. But just now, I am starting to think about my own SaaS. I
always had a lot of ideas. But what did I face? I quickly built core SaaS logic because of the power
of interest, and I always got burned out when I had to create user authorization, payments, email
sending, public API, teams, member invites, etc.

What if I build the modern SaaS template once and will use it in all my SaaS ideas? That is why I am
starting to develop the modern SaaS template — Saasfy!

## What is Saasfy exactly?
