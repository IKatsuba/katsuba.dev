If you’ve worked with Angular, you’ve probably encountered RxJS. Observables, overhead constructs,
many arguments to the pipe method, and each argument is returned by a different function with a
different number of arguments. There are intuitive functions like `filter` or `map`. The former
explicitly filters values in the observable, and the latter changes these values. Such functions are
called operators. And the deeper you go into RxJS, the more different operators you learn. And
eventually, you get to observables of observables – Higher Order Observables. There are special
operators to work with such flows – Higher Order Operators (HOO). They can flatten observables or,
in other words, make them normal.

In this article, I will show you that there is nothing mythical about HOO, and I will tell you in
which cases you need to use Higher Order Operators. Now you will think that this is a boring
longread, but take your time. We will look at just 4 operators: `switchMap`, `exhaustMap`,
`concatMap` and `mergeMap`.

## switchMap

`switchMap` is by far the most popular of all. But why? For one simple reason – this operator gets
rid of the race condition.

Let’s examine the code:

```typescript
const searchInput = document.getElementById('search-input');
const search$ = fromEvent(searchInput, 'input').pipe(map((event) => event.target.value));

search$.subscribe((query) => {
  http.get('/search', { params: { query } }).subcribe((result) => {
    console.log(result);
  });
});
```

In this code, we find the input that the user is interacting with and subscribe to the `input`
event. That is, the `search$` observable emits strings. Inside the subscription, we can see that for
each string emit, a request is sent to the server and the service response is output to the console.

You can see at least two problems in this code:

1.  **Race state.** Usually, when searching for something, it is important for a user to see the
    result of exactly the last query. But this kind of code does not give us a guarantee that the
    last data printed to the console corresponds to the last string emitted in the `search$`
    observable.
2.  **Subscribe in subscribe** and no unsubscribe. There is an excellent rule of thumb that can save
    you a lot of trouble — there should be an unsubscribed for every subscription. This will at
    least reduce the likelihood of memory leaks.

But let’s think about how search should work:

1.  When receiving a new string, check for active requests
2.  If there are no active requests, go to step 4
3.  Unsubscribe from previous requests
4.  Subscribe to a new request
5.  Output result to the console

This can be implemented in the following way:

```typescript
const searchInput = document.getElementById('search-input');

const search$ = fromEvent(searchInput, 'input').pipe(map((event) => event.target.value));

let subscription;
search$.subscribe((query) => {
  if (subscription) {
    subscription.unsubscribe();
  }

  subscription = http.get('/search', { params: { query } }).subcribe((result) => {
    console.log(result);
  });
});
```

But what if I told you that the first 4 requirement clauses are done by the `switchMap` operator?
Let's rewrite the code:

```typescript
const searchInput = document.getElementById('search-input');
const search$ = fromEvent(searchInput, 'input').pipe(map((event) => event.target.value));

search$
  .pipe(switchMap((query) => http.get('/search', { params: { query } })))
  .subscribe((result) => {
    console.log(result);
  });
```

The `switchMap` ensures that we always get the results of the last observable and saves us from the
race condition. And a nice bonus is that unsubscribing from the external subscription will
automatically unsubscribe from the internal one. Profit!

**Resume.** `switchMap` can be used in cases when we care about the result of the last action, for
example, when searching or implementing infinite scrolling. If all previous actions can be ignored,
then we can safely take `switchMap`.

## exhaustMap

`exhaustMap` is definitely the most unpopular of all. The reason is not completely clear to me, but
it can also be used to implement search, but using a different approach.

```typescript
const searchInput = document.getElementById('search-input');
const searchButton = document.getElementById('search-button');

const searchButtonClick$ = fromEvent(searchButton, 'click');

searchButtonClick$.subscribe((result) => {
  const query = searchInput.value;
  http.get('/search', { params: { query } }).subscribe((result) => {
    console.log(result);
  });
});
```

In this code, the initiator of the query is the button click.

Actually, this code has the same problems as in the previous example, but here we have different
requirements:

1.  Check if there are active requests by pressing the button
2.  If there is an active one, do nothing and wait for the next click
3.  If there is no active one, subscribe to the request execution
4.  Output the result to the console

Let’s implement it:

```typescript
const searchInput = document.getElementById('search-input')
const searchButton = document.getElementById('search-button')

const searchButtonClick$ = fromEvent(searchButton, 'click')

let isRequestPending = false
searchButtonClick$.subscribe((result) => {
  if (isRequestPending) {
    return;
  }

  isRequestPending = true;
  const query = searchInput.value;
  http.get('/search', { params: { query } } }).subscribe((result) => {
    isRequestPending = false;
    console.log(result);
  });
});
```

As in the first case, we needed one more variable outside the observable. This adds complexity to
the code and if we want to change it we will have to rewrite everything. Well, as you have already
guessed, `exhaustMap` comes to our rescue.

```typescript
const searchInput = document.getElementById('search-input')
const searchButton = document.getElementById('search-button')

const searchInput$ = fromEvent(searchButton, 'click')

searchInput$.pipe(
  exhaustMap(() => {
    const query = searchInput.value;
    return http.get('/search', { params: { query } }
  })
).subscribe((result) => {
  console.log(result);
});
```

**Resume.** `exhaustMap` should be used in cases where, when an observable subscription is active,
the others can be ignored, as in the case of a keystroke search or, for example, when skipping
animation start events when playing an animation.

## mergeMap

`mergeMap` is an operator that merges all internal observables into a single output observable. This
means that the inner observables can terminate in any order, and their results will be merged. And
that's the simplest explanation I could squeeze out of myself.

Let’s move on to examples:

```typescript
entityId$.subscribe((id) => {
  entityService.get(id).subscribe(() => {
    entityStore.upsertItem(entity);
  });
});
```

In this code, we see `entityId$` is an observable of strings with the ID of some entity. Here we
have to request entity data from the server for each ID and add or update this entity in the store.
Actually, this is what our code does and there is nothing to solve here. But there are problems, and
in this case, they are absolutely identical to the previous ones. Let's try to complicate the task
and introduce a limit of 3 requests at one moment of time.

We solve it:

```typescript
const CONCURRENT_REQUESTS = 3;
let activeRequests = 0;
const queue = [];

function processNext() {
  if (queue.length === 0 || activeRequests >= CONCURRENT_REQUESTS) {
    return;
  }

  const id = queue.shift();
  activeRequests++;

  entityService.get(id).subscribe((entity) => {
    entityStore.upsertItem(entity);
    activeRequests--;

    processNext();
  });
}

entityId$.subscribe((id) => {
  queue.push(id);
  processNext();
});
```

I didn’t even try to test the code to see if it worked because I wrote it directly in the text
editor. The code became difficult to read. The `processNext` function has several side effects
inside. And there are additional variables outside the observable and function. Putting it all
together is quite difficult.

These are precisely the kind of tasks that `mergeMap` solves. Let's rewrite the first example using
this operator:

```typescript
entityId$.pipe(mergeMap((id) => entityService.get(id))).subscribe((entity) => {
  entityStore.upsertItem(entity);
});
```

In this code, `mergeMap` subscribes to each observable returned by `entityService.get(id)` and
outputs their values in one single observable.

Okay, but what about the limit of 3 requests at one time? It turns out that `mergeMap` already knows
how to do everything. The second argument to `mergeMap` takes a number that just sets up the
competitiveness.

```typescript
    entityId$.pipe(
      mergeMap((id) => entityService.get(id), 3))
    ).subscribe((entity) => {
      entityStore.upsertItem(entity);
    });
```

That’s it!

**Resume.** `mergeMap` is great when you want to perform parallel actions and merge their results.
However, you have to be careful as there can be many active queries if the source observable emits
values too fast.

## concatMap

`concatMap` is the last higher-order operator. The key difference is that concatMap maintains the
order of execution. It will wait for one internal observable to complete before moving on to the
next.

To practically look at its use, we can take the previous example and change its requirements. It so
happens that we are no longer satisfied with disordered requests, and we want to execute them one by
one instead of in parallel. That is, the competitiveness should become equal to one.

```typescript
    entityId$.pipe(
      mergeMap((id) => entityService.get(id), 1))
    ).subscribe((entity) => {
      entityStore.upsertItem(entity);
    });
```

But mergeMap with concreteness 1 does the same thing as concatMap! Literally. This is perfectly
visible in the
[source code](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/blob/master/src/internal/operators/concatMap.ts#L60)
operator.

<Image src={concatMapImage} alt="ConcatMap" />

That is, the use of mergeMap with concurrency 1 is such a frequent case that it was put into a
separate operator.

**Resume.** `concatMap` is great for situations where the order of execution is important. If you
want to process a sequence of actions without parallel processing, this is your choice.

## Conclusion

Higher-order operators are a powerful tool in the arsenal of every developer working with reactive
programming. They provide flexibility and elegance when handling complex data observables and allow
us to shorten code, making it more readable and maintainable.

- The `switchMap` is an excellent choice when we only care about the last emit result, such as in
  real-time search.
- `exhaustMap` is ideal for cases where we need to ignore new observables until the current one
  terminates.
- `mergeMap` allows multiple incoming observables to be processed in parallel, but can lead to
  overloading if the number of concurrent observables is not controlled.
- `concatMap` guarantees the order of processing by executing each internal observable sequentially.

When used correctly, these operators can handle many reactive tasks, be it event observables from
the user interface, HTTP requests, or even complex animation sequences.

However, the keyword here is _correct usage_. Always analyze the requirements of your application
and choose the right operator carefully. This will help you avoid unwanted side effects and create
reactive solutions that can scale and be easily maintained.

Reactive programming offers many tools, and among them, higher-order operators hold a special place.
By taking time to study and understand their peculiarities, you can significantly improve the
quality and efficiency of your code.
