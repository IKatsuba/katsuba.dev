Angular 16 was officially released on May 3, 2023, bringing with it several significant updates and
improvements. One of the most substantial changes in this release was the removal of the Angular
Compatibility Compiler (`ngcc`). This modification significantly impacts the process of working with
Angular, making it even more user-friendly and efficient.

## What is `ngcc`?

The Angular Compatibility Compiler (`ngcc`) is a compiler designed to convert libraries compiled
with the Angular Compiler (`ngc`) into a format compatible with Angular Ivy. Ivy is a rendering and
compiling engine introduced in Angular 9.

`ngcc` performs a post-processing transformation of npm packages located in `node_modules`. This
transformation is needed to ensure Ivy compatibility if the library was compiled using the previous
View Engine compiler.

## Why was ngcc removed?

The removal of `ngcc` is the last step forward in the transition to Ivy. Since the introduction of
Ivy in Angular 9, Angular developers have actively encouraged the community and library authors to
switch to Ivy. With the release of Angular 16, this process has become final, and now all libraries
must be compatible with Ivy.

The removal of `ngcc` simplifies the build process and reduces build time, as there is no need for
additional code transformation. It also makes integration with other tools like Webpack easier and
facilitates development and debugging, as there are no complexities associated with having two
different library formats.

## What does this mean for developers?

For most developers, the removal of `ngcc` means that they need to ensure that all their
dependencies are Ivy compatible. If you find that some of your dependencies have not yet been
updated, you will have to contact the authors of the library or look for alternatives.

However, the removal of `ngcc` is a significant step forward for Angular, making the framework even
more modern and efficient. It means that Angular becomes even faster and lighter, leading to
improved performance of your applications.

Also, this change simplifies the development process. Without `ngcc`, your applications will compile
and run faster, reducing the time spent waiting. In addition to this, the removal of ngcc simplifies
the debugging process, as developers will now only have to deal with one library format.

## Conclusion

The removal of the Angular Compatibility Compiler (`ngcc`) in Angular 16 is an important step
forward in improving the framework’s performance and efficiency. This update makes Angular even more
modern and faster, leading to improved performance of your applications and facilitating the
development process. For developers, this means the necessity to ensure that all their libraries and
dependencies are compatible with Ivy, but overall, this change brings more benefits than
inconveniences.
